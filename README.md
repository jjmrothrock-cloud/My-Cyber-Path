# Welcome to My-Cyber-Path

This repository is a personal chronicle of my journey through the world of cybersecurity. As I navigate various tools, techniques, and discoveries, I’ll be documenting interesting findings, write-ups, and lessons learned along the way.

## What You’ll Find Here

### WSL Root Access Exploration: 

One of the initial documents in this repo covers a scenario exploring root access within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). It’s a detailed write-up of some security behaviors and configurations that I found noteworthy.

### Scribbr Website Behavior and Config Paths:

Another document here dives into an interesting quirk I encountered with the Scribbr AI detector and how certain configuration paths can trigger unexpected behaviors. This write-up documents the steps I took and the solutions I found.

##Why This Repo?

I created My-Cyber-Path to serve as a living journal of my cybersecurity learning adventure. By making it public, I hope it can be a resource for others who are on similar paths or just curious about some of the hands-on quirks and discoveries that come up in cybersecurity work.

Feel free to explore the files, follow along, and I hope you find something useful here!
